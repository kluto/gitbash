Making Git configurations
Run the following Git configuration commands. The first one will need to be modified if you are using a text editor other than Sublime, or if Sublime is installed in another location for you. See this page for the correct command for a couple of other popular text editors. For any other editor, you'll need to enter the command you use to launch that editor from Git Bash.

git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 3/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3


Make sure you can start your editor from Git Bash
If you use Sublime, you can do this by adding the following line to your .bash_profile:

alias subl="C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/sublime_text.exe"
Restart Git Bash
You'll need to close and re-open Git Bash before all your changes take effect.
